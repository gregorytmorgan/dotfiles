# dotfiles
#
# This repo has evolved into more than just dotfile, now it's closer to 'useful files'
#

Usage:
  1. clone the repo
  2. cd to the cloned repo
  3. run ./setup
    - Files that already exist will be moved to someFile.timestamp
    - For each repo file a symlink is created in the appropriate location pointing back the the repo copy (so don't delete the cloned repo)
