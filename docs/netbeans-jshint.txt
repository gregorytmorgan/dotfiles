Linting with Netbeans 8.x
========

See http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/58580/jshint

For Netbeans v8.2 jshint plugin (v2.9.4) is available, though it doesn't seem to respect inline
configs e.g. /*jshint ... or a .jshintrc file, but relies on the option config dialog for the
plugin.  Strangely it does respect inline def of globals? though it seems to use a jslint/eslint style
def e.g. 'global' instead of jshints 'globals'.

In the past I believe I've seen Netbeans read .jshintrc correctly?

Does presence of .jshintrc enable/disable checking?

jshint node: true required for 'use strict;'

Using Netbeans v8.2 I was able to manually download and install Netbeans 11 jshint plugin v1.3. This
is useful in that it uses jshint 2.10.1, which has usable improvements.
